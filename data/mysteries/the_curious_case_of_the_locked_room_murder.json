  "title": "The Curious Case of the Locked Room Murder",
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "mystery": "\nIt was a dreary London afternoon when Sherlock Holmes and I received an urgent telegram from Inspector Lestrade. A prominent banker, Mr. Jonathan Fairfax, had been found dead in his study at his Mayfair townhouse. The circumstances were puzzling, as the room had been locked from the inside.\nUpon our arrival, we were greeted by a visibly agitated Inspector Lestrade. \"Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson, thank goodness you're here,\" he exclaimed. \"We're completely baffled by this one.\"\nHolmes's keen eyes surveyed the scene as we entered the study. Mr. Fairfax lay slumped over his desk, a single gunshot wound to his temple. A revolver lay on the floor beside him, and the key to the study was still in the lock on the inside of the door.\n\"Who discovered the body?\" Holmes inquired, carefully circling the corpse.\n\"That would be the housekeeper, Mrs. Pearson,\" Lestrade replied. \"She came to bring Mr. Fairfax his afternoon tea and found the door locked. When she received no response to her knocks, she fetched the butler, Mr. Thompson, who then called for the police.\"\nHolmes nodded, his gaze sweeping across the room. \"And who else was present in the house at the time of the murder?\"\nLestrade consulted his notebook. \"Apart from the housekeeper and the butler, there was Mr. Fairfax's nephew, Mr. Charles Fairfax, who's staying here while on break from university. Oh, and Mr. Fairfax's business partner, Mr. Harold Whitaker, arrived shortly before the body was discovered. He claims he had an appointment with Mr. Fairfax.\"\nAs Holmes examined the body and the surrounding area, I noticed several items of interest. On the desk was a half-empty glass of brandy, a leather-bound ledger, and several crumpled pieces of paper. The waste basket nearby was filled with more crumpled papers and what appeared to be the remains of a burned photograph.\n\"Watson,\" Holmes called, gesturing to the window. \"What do you make of this?\"\nI approached and saw a small hole in one of the windowpanes. \"It appears to be a bullet hole, Holmes,\" I replied.\n\"Indeed,\" he mused. \"And yet, the window is latched from the inside.\"\nOver the next hour, Holmes meticulously examined every inch of the room, occasionally muttering to himself and making notes in his small black notebook. Finally, he turned to Lestrade. \"I believe it's time we spoke with our suspects, Inspector. Shall we adjourn to the drawing room?\"\nIn the drawing room, we found a nervous-looking group awaiting us. Mrs. Pearson, the housekeeper, was a plump, motherly woman in her fifties. Mr. Thompson, the butler, was a tall, thin man with a severe expression. Charles Fairfax, the victim's nephew, was a handsome young man in his early twenties, while Harold Whitaker was a portly gentleman in his sixties.\nHolmes began his questioning with Mrs. Pearson, who confirmed that she had last seen Mr. Fairfax alive when she brought him his lunch at noon. Mr. Thompson corroborated her story, adding that he had admitted Mr. Whitaker to the house at 2:30 PM.\nCharles Fairfax claimed he had been in his room all afternoon, studying for his upcoming exams. When pressed, he admitted that he and his uncle had argued the previous evening about Charles's excessive gambling debts.\nMr. Whitaker appeared visibly shaken. \"I arrived for our 2:30 appointment to discuss some troubling discrepancies I had discovered in our company's accounts,\" he explained. \"When I was informed of Jonathan's death, I was shocked. I can't believe he would take his own life over this.\"\nAs the questioning progressed, it became clear that each suspect had a potential motive. Charles stood to inherit his uncle's considerable fortune. Mr. Whitaker's mention of financial discrepancies suggested a possible embezzlement scheme. Even Mrs. Pearson and Mr. Thompson, long-time employees of Mr. Fairfax, might have had grievances against their employer.\nAfter the interviews, Holmes spent several minutes in quiet contemplation, his fingers steepled under his chin. Suddenly, he sprang to his feet. \"I believe I have solved this puzzle, gentlemen,\" he announced. \"If you would all follow me back to the study.\"\nOnce we were all assembled in the room where Mr. Fairfax had met his end, Holmes began his explanation. \"At first glance, this appears to be either a suicide or an impossible murder in a locked room. However, the truth is far simpler.\"\nHe pointed to the bullet hole in the window. \"This hole is key to understanding what transpired here. The killer shot Mr. Fairfax from outside the window, then used a long piece of string to pull the window shut and latch it from the outside. The string was then pulled free, leaving us with an apparently locked room.\"\nHolmes then turned to face the suspects. \"The culprit is none other than Mr. Harold Whitaker.\"\nGasps filled the room as all eyes turned to the portly businessman, who had gone deathly pale.\n\"Mr. Whitaker arrived at 2:30, not for a meeting, but to confront Mr. Fairfax about the embezzlement he had discovered. However, it wasn't Mr. Fairfax who was the embezzler, but Mr. Whitaker himself. Fearing exposure, he shot Mr. Fairfax from the garden, using the clever trick with the string to create the illusion of a locked room.\"\nHolmes produced a small fragment of string from his pocket. \"This piece of string, caught on a rosebush beneath the study window, confirms my theory. The burned photograph in the waste basket was likely evidence of Mr. Whitaker's misdeeds, which Mr. Fairfax had confronted him about.\"\nMr. Whitaker, his composure crumbling, sank into a nearby chair. \"He was going to ruin me,\" he whispered. \"Everything I've worked for, gone in an instant. I... I panicked.\"\nAs Inspector Lestrade moved to arrest Mr. Whitaker, I couldn't help but marvel at my friend's brilliant deductions. Once again, Sherlock Holmes had brought a killer to justice, unraveling a mystery that had seemed impenetrable to all but his remarkable mind.\n",
