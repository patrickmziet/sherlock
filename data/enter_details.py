TITLE = "The Enigma of the Tarnished Tiara"
MYSTERY = """
The autumn chill permeated 221B Baker Street as Inspector Lestrade burst in, his face ashen. "Holmes, we need you at Blackmoor Hall. Lady Eleanor Blackmoor has been murdered!"
Sherlock Holmes's eyes glimmered with interest. "Details, Lestrade."
"Found dead in her private study, strangled with her own pearl necklace. The Blackmoor Tiara, worth a fortune, is missing."
At Blackmoor Hall, a Victorian mansion shrouded in mist, they were greeted by the butler, Jameson, his lined face betraying no emotion. "This way, gentlemen."
In the study, Dr. Watson examined Lady Eleanor's body. "Strangled, indeed. About ten hours ago."
Holmes scrutinized the room. A half-empty teacup sat on the desk, a faint lipstick smear on its rim. Near the fireplace, a small pile of ash contained fragments of paper. On the mantel, a photograph of Lady Eleanor wearing the tiara stood next to a bowl of polished chestnuts.
Lady Eleanor's daughter, Sophia, entered, her eyes red-rimmed. "Mother and I had tea yesterday afternoon. She seemed distracted."
"When did you last see the tiara?" Holmes inquired.
"Two days ago. Mother wore it to the Autumn Charity Ball."
Lord Richard Blackmoor, Eleanor's husband, joined them. "Eleanor was wearing it yesterday evening. I saw her before I left for my club."
Holmes raised an eyebrow. "You were out all night, my lord?"
"Yes, I... I often stay at my club when in London."
The groundskeeper, Tom Farley, a burly man with calloused hands, reported seeing a figure near the west wing around midnight. "Thought it was Lord Richard returning, but couldn't be sure in the fog."
In the kitchen, the cook, Mrs. Brewster, mentioned preparing Lady Eleanor's favorite chestnut soup the previous evening. "Her ladyship always enjoyed it this time of year."
As they explored the house, Holmes noticed Lord Richard's muddy boots by the back door and a fresh scratch on Sophia's cheek.
Interviewing the maid, Lucy, revealed more. "I heard raised voices from the study yesterday afternoon. Lady Eleanor and Mr. Harrington, her solicitor, seemed to be arguing."
Holmes examined Lady Eleanor's correspondence. A letter from a London jeweler caught his eye, detailing the creation of a replica tiara.
As evening fell, Holmes gathered everyone in the drawing room. "I can now reveal the culprit behind Lady Eleanor's murder and the missing tiara."
Tension filled the air as Holmes continued, "The murderer is... Jameson, the butler."
Gasps echoed through the room. Jameson remained impassive.
"Lady Eleanor discovered that the real Blackmoor Tiara had been replaced with a replica. She was planning to expose the thief, not realizing the danger she was in. Jameson, you've been slowly replacing the estate's valuables with fakes, siphoning off the fortune. The letter from the jeweler confirmed your scheme."
"But the strangling? The necklace?" Lestrade interjected.
"A clever misdirection. Jameson used the necklace post-mortem. Lady Eleanor actually died from poison – chestnut poison, to be precise. Highly toxic if prepared incorrectly, and undetectable in her favorite soup. The teacup was placed to suggest she died later than she did, providing Jameson with an alibi."
Holmes turned to Jameson. "You burnt the real letter from Lady Eleanor to her solicitor in the fireplace, replacing it with a forged one to throw off suspicion. But you missed a crucial detail – the ash contained traces of her personal stationery watermark."
Jameson's composure finally cracked. "How could you possibly know?"
"The chestnuts on the mantel. Freshly polished, yet you missed one. It bore the distinct tarnish that comes from handling the poison. Elementary, when one observes all the details."
As Lestrade led Jameson away, Holmes smiled at the astonished family. "The tiara, I suspect, is hidden in the one place no one would think to look – the butter churn in the dairy shed. Clever, but not clever enough."
